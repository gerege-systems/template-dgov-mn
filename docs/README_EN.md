# Government Template Platform V3.0

> **Цахим засаглалыг бүтээх суурь** — **eID based · AI enabled** — a
> production-ready foundation for building any digital-government service.

**Government Template Platform V3.0** is the *foundation on which digital
governance is built*: a Clean-Architecture Go backend + Next.js BFF frontend +
Gemini AI pipeline, wired together, security-hardened and ready to extend into
any system. Build the value, not the plumbing — the identity, security, AI and
service scaffolding come solved from day one. A reference deployment runs as
**Government Template Platform** at [template.dgov.mn](https://template.dgov.mn), showcasing the
platform's eID single sign-on in production.

A production-ready, security-hardened **full-stack foundation** built on Clean
Architecture — the base layer for building digital governance. It pairs a Go
(**chi · net/http + pgx (pgxpool) + PostgreSQL + Redis**) backend with a Next.js
(**BFF**) frontend, wired together and ready to extend into any system. The
backend uses the standard library `net/http` with the
[go-chi/chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi) router and the
[jackc/pgx](https://github.com/jackc/pgx) driver with hand-written SQL — no ORM.

## 📌 Origin & Open Source

The **backend** is derived from the open-source
[snykk/go-rest-boilerplate](https://github.com/snykk/go-rest-boilerplate)
(MIT, by Najib Fikri); we ported the HTTP layer **Gin → chi (net/http)** and the
data layer **sqlx → pgx (pgxpool, hand-written SQL)**, keeping the full feature
set. Upstream attribution is retained in [AUTHORS](../AUTHORS). This project is
**MIT-licensed** — see [LICENSE](../LICENSE).

## Features

- **Clean Architecture** — `handler → usecase → repository → domain`, no back-imports; the business core never imports the web framework.
- **Auth — eID + Google** — the only login method is **Login with eID** (eID Mongolia Relying Party: QR code / mobile deep-link / national-ID push with a long-poll session). Alongside it, **Google OAuth** account-linking. Sessions are JWT access + refresh (rotation); logout revokes both (refresh + access deny-list). There is no password or email/OTP login.
- **eID PKI profile** — reads the signed-in citizen's eID identity from the IdP: linked organizations & authorized signers, certificates, registered devices, and activity.
- **Organizations & membership** — create/lookup organizations (state-registry lookup via Gerege Verify/XYP) and manage members/roles, RLS-scoped per user.
- **Government services portal** — the citizen-facing `Төрийн үйлчилгээ` surface: service catalogue, applications, references, notifications, payments, appointments.
- **API gateway** — admin-managed services / routes / consumers / API keys / policies with request telemetry (overview + logs).
- **OIDC provider (SSO)** — the platform itself can act as an identity provider: the platform's own Go OAuth2/OIDC provider drives the login/consent/logout flows so relying parties can sign in through it (`Sign in with Government SSO` in the reference deployment). Enabled when `OAUTH_ISSUER` is configured.
- **Document signing (PAdES)** — server-side PDF signing through eID Mongolia `/v3`, with a persistent Document-Signer certificate; a sign-relay lets third-party RPs sign through the platform's eID credentials.
- **Third-party integrations** — per-user OAuth links (Google Drive/Meet, Dropbox) with tokens encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM), plus **Gerege Space** app-native SFTP storage.
- **AI pipeline (Gemini)** — SDK-free REST client with function calling: text/voice chat, speech-to-text, text-to-speech, live translation. Layered system prompt (hardcoded guardrails + admin-configurable scope/instructions in the DB) keeps the assistant inside its configured domain; a `search_knowledge` tool grounds answers in the `ai_knowledge` table.
- **Audit log** — hash-chained, append-only audit trail (admin-only read + integrity verify).
- **RBAC & super admin** — dynamic roles + permission catalogue; a 4-role model (**superadmin → admin → manager → user**) where super admin is the only role that can manage admin accounts.
- **Site appearance** — admin-configurable site-wide look (accent / font / density / theme) for public pages, plus per-user overrides.
- **Security-hardened** — strict security headers (CSP, HSTS, COOP/COEP/CORP), CORS allow-list, rate limiting, full HTTP server timeouts, parameterized queries, Postgres Row-Level Security with a boot-time enforceability guard. See [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md).
- **Observability** — OpenTelemetry tracing + Prometheus metrics + structured Zap logs; `/metrics` and `/swagger` are gated behind a bearer token in production.
- **Frontend BFF** — the browser talks only to same-origin Next.js routes, which proxy to the backend server-side (tokens never reach client JS); double CSRF defense (custom header + origin check), TanStack Query data layer.
- **Tested** — unit tests + testcontainers integration tests.

## Quick start

**Prerequisites:** Go 1.26+, Node 20+, PostgreSQL 15+, Redis 7+ (Docker recommended for the full stack).

```bash
# 1) Backend  →  http://localhost:8080
cd backend
cp internal/config/.env.example internal/config/.env   # set JWT_SECRET (≥32 chars), DB, Redis, EID_* RP creds

# 2) Frontend →  http://localhost:3000
cd ../frontend
cp .env.example .env.local                              # BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8080
npm install
npm run dev
```

Or bring up the whole stack (db + redis + migrate + api + web):

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Open **http://localhost:3000** and choose **Login with eID** (scan the QR / open the eID mobile app, or enter a national ID to receive a push). Google account-linking appears when its credentials are configured.
